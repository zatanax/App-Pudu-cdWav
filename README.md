# AudioCut

AudioCut is a Windows desktop application designed to work with WAV audio files, allowing users to visually define and manage audio cuts (chapters) and export them as separate tracks from the original audio file.

The application is focused on precise audio segmentation, making it ideal for editing long recordings such as concerts, rehearsals, interviews, or continuous audio sessions.
